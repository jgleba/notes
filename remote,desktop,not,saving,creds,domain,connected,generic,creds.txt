If you don't want to change local or server side GPOs:

Go to Control Panel -> Credential Manager. You will see three sections:

    Windows Credentials
    Certificate-Based Credentials
    Generic Credentials

Remove the credentials from Windows Credentials and add it to Generic Credentials
