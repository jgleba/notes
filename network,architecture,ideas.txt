network architecture ideas


lawrence systems - youtube - seems like has lots of experience
ubnt on separate vlan? no, I usually all the servers on native vlan and then segment out all the other networks to other vlans
rationale  - native when trunk to all they can be in there, helps with dumb switch to put a couple things in there

j edit
vlans for outter (user) networks, devices (servers) on native vlan

interesting, with my experience so far (plextec, offices and data center, sfa, my own stuff (jgdc1) and logic) have used lots of vlans, separate every network into its own vlan, nothing on native
