If you must run Windows 10... #

Heaven help you:

    Microsoft Has A Software Quality Problem
    Windows 10 is a disaster, I'm bugging out, here is why
    An open letter to Microsoft management re: Windows updating
    Microsoft's Windows 10 October Update Has Turned Into A Huge Mess
    Microsoft Is Talking About Windows 10's Quality, But Changing Nothing
    Worst Windows 10 version ever? Microsoft's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad October

Barring divine intervention, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 (formerly LTSB) may be the least bad option:

    no Cortana
    no semiannual feature upgrades
    not a single tile on the default Start menu
    telemetry can be set to 0 (the lowest level)
    no "Show suggestions occassionally in Start"
    despite some misbelief, WSL and Hyper-V work just fine
    receives security and stability updates for ten years (unlike Windows 10 Home & Pro versions, which reach "end of service" after just 18 months from their initial release)
    no Metro/Windows 8-style/Modern/Windows Store/Universal/Windows apps like Store, Edge, Calendar, Camera, News, Weather, etc.
    no zombie games like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Bubble Witch 3 Saga, March of Empires, etc. that refuse to die (part of Microsoft's plan for "post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues" much like the recent Mail app debacle)

However, be aware that LTSC requires a volume license (VL) agreement, making onerous audits potentially more probable:

    Rockin' on without Microsoft
    The BSA's "nauseating" anti-piracy tactics
    IT Software Audits Gone Bad: Beware the BSA
    Microsoft licence cops kick in TWICE as many customers' doors as rivals
    Can Microsoft audit you (your company) if you don't have a volume license contract with them?

(despite Microsoft's own apparent need for a thorough inspection:

    Microsoft used pirated music software - report
    Pirated software used to create help content in Microsoft's Windows XP).

While five licenses are required to enter into a new VL agreement, they need not all be for LTSC. According to a rep I spoke with at a Microsoft Partner, this combination would work as an upgrade from a Windows OEM license (i.e., it would allow a user who bought a PC with Windows 10 preinstalled to run Windows 10 LTSC instead):

    1x Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 Single Upgrade Open Business (KW4-00190)
    4x Microsoft Identity Manager - 1 User CAL - Open Business (NK7-00031)

Here are links and prices from three well-known Microsoft Partners, though you should definitely confirm details with a rep before purchasing:

    Provantage:
        Windows Enterprise LTSC 2019 Single Upgrade Open License Program NL $269.04
        Microsoft Identity Manager User CAL SA Open Business $7.81
    Connection:
        Microsoft Corp. MOB Windows Ent LTSC 2019 Upgrade License Only $294.93
        Microsoft Corp. Open License Identity Manager User CAL Software Assurance Only $8.68
    CDW:
        Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 - upgrade license $295.99
        Microsoft Identity Manager - software assurance - 1 user CAL $9.99

For those hapless souls stuck on Windows 10 Home or Pro, see:

    Optimize-Offline, a Windows Image (WIM) optimization script which aims for "the removal of unnecessary bloat, privacy and security enhancements, cleaner aesthetics, increased performance and a significantly better user experience."
    O&O ShutUp10, a portable app for tweaking Windows 10 security, privacy, and many other settings.
