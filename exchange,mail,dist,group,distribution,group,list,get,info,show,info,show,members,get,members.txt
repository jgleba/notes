Get-DistributionGroup -ResultSize Unlimited
Get-DistributionGroup -ResultSize Unlimited | select Name,PrimarySmtpAddress,SamAccountName

$groups = Get-DistributionGroup -ResultSize Unlimited
$groups | ForEach-Object {
$group = $_
Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity $group.Name -ResultSize Unlimited
}

==
JEDIT, A BIT BETTER, BUT STILL NOT WORKING RIGHT
==

$groups = Get-DistributionGroup -ResultSize Unlimited | select Name,PrimarySmtpAddress,SamAccountName
$groups | ForEach-Object {
$group = $_
Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity $group.SamAccountName -ResultSize Unlimited
}

CLOSER, BETTER, NOT QUITE

$groupmembers = foreach($i in Get-DistributionGroup) {
	Get-DistributionGroupMember $i | select Name,@{n='Member';e={$i.Name}}
}
Write-Host $groupmembers

==
EVEN CLOSER, EXPORTS TO CSV, ALMOST THERE
==

}
$groupmembers | Export-Csv c:\j\tmp\groupmembers.csv -NoTypeInformation

TRYING FROM SPECIFIC OU, WORKS, BEST SO FAR

ANOTHER WAY - NOT AS GOOD AS ABOVE

BEST SO FAR, REPEATING FROM ABOVE

GETS SAM FOR BOTH USER AND GROUP NAME - WORKING - GOOD ONE

	Get-DistributionGroupMember $i | select SamAccountName,@{n='Member';e={$i.SamAccountName}}
}
$groupmembers | Export-Csv c:\j\tmp\groupmembers.csv -NoTypeInformation

==
GETS SAM FOR USER AND NAME OF GROUP - WORKS - IS WHAT IS WAS LOOKING FOR - BEST - BEST
==

TRYING FROM SPECIFIC DOMAIN, WORKING TO GET GROUPS AND GROUP MEMBERS FROM SPECIFIC DOMAIN - WORKS

SHORT ANSWER, THESE ARE THE BEST
==

==
SPECIFIC DOMAIN, GET GROUPS, GET MEMBERS

$groupmembers = foreach($i in Get-DistributionGroup | where {$_.emailaddresses -match "ab3w.com"}) {
