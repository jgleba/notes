Sometimes you try to open a remote desktop connection to a machine only to get an error message that "the password has expired".

If the remote machine does not enforce NLA (Network Level Authentication), it is still possible to start a remote desktop session by disabling NLA on the client (currenlty not possible from the menu on my remote desktop client v.6.3.96000 that came with windows 8.1).

Add the following setting to your .rdp file ("C:\Users\<User>\Documents\Default.rdp" if you aren't using a specific one).
