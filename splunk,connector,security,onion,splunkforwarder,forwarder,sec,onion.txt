finally I can help someone here! I'm doing this now...

Download the universal forwarder from splunk. Make sure you get the appropriate one! Install it on your seconion box. It will install to /opt/splunkforwarder/

In your snort.conf file, 
make sure you have:

output alert_full: alert.full

Restart Snort to push changes
alert.full will be in your config logdir:/somepath

In your splunk config files,

/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local$ cat inputs.conf
[monitor:///pathto/alert.full]
index = an_indexname_that_makes_since_to_you_on_your_splunkSERVER
followTail = 1
sourcetype = snort_alert_full

/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local$ cat outputs.conf
[tcpout]
defaultGroup=my_indexers

[tcpout:my_indexers]
server=ip.address.of.splunkServer:port_you_are_listening_on
[tcpout-server://ip.address.of.splunkServer:port_you_are_listening_on]

restart your splunk forwarder

/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart

I'll keep an eye on this post incase you have problems.
