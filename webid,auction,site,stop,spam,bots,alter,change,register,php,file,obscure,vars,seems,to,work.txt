TRYING

Files:
./register.php
./Your theme template file >>> register.tpl

Find anything that says "$TPL_name_hidden" or "$TPL_name" on both files and replace the part that says "name" with something unique like "$TPL_myusersoso_hidden" or "$TPL_myusersoso" . They must be the same regardless if it ends with _hidden or not.
The spambot knows the form name field is named "$TPL_name_hidden" or "$TPL_name" because it was designed to breach free scripts like webid, wordpress, joomla, phpbb and so on.

$TPL_name_hidden to $TPL_nameabc123_hidden
$TPL_name to $TPL_nameabc123

4 occurences in register.php for $TPL_name_hidden
1 occurences in register.php for TPL_name
2 occurences in register.tpl for TPL_name

SEEMS TO WORK, DOESNT BREAK WEBID SO FAR
