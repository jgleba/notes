THEN ON NODE 1

sudo service mariadb stop

==
START UP

Quick recover of PerconaDB cluster failure
If all of your DB servers crashed simultaneously, you need to find out which node has the latest data. It may be more than 1 node, in which case you can pick either as the one to bootstrap from.

mysqld_safe –wsrep-recover

Look for the ‘Recovered position’ line in the output, and note the number at the end for each node. Whichever node has the highest number, that one will be your bootstrap node.

pgrep mysql

If the above returns any process IDs, run the following to kill them:

kill -9 1234567

(replace 1234567 with the IDs listed by pgrep)

vi /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat

Edit the 0 next to safe_to_bootstrap to 1.
/etc/init.d/mysql bootstrap-pxc

Now on the other nodes, run this:
service mysql start

HAVE HAD THE BEST LUCK THIS WAY - 071819

WHEN ALL CRASH AT SAME TIME OR CLOSE TOGETHER (STORAGE ISSUE, HV CRASH)

CHECK GRASTATE.DAT ON ALL NODES

sudo cat /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat

IF ALL -1 then edit grastate.dat and change "safe_to_bootstrap" to 1 on node1, then bootstrap cluster from node1

sudo galera_new_cluster

START OTHER NODES WITH

sudo service mariadb start

ONCE HAD SEQ NUMBER -1 ON 2 NODES AND VERY HIGH NUMBER
HAD TRIED TO START FROM OTHER NODES PRIOR, SO MAYBE THATS WHY FAILED
CHANGED GRASTATE.DAT SAFE TO BOOTSRAP BUT FAILED, WAS NODE2 THAT WAS HIGHEST NUMBER
HAD TO RESTORE THAT TIME, WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND 070119
