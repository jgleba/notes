I am not sure if this helps, but this configuration works well with Juniper.

Std export:

/interface bonding
add comment="Primary Bonded Interface" name=bonding1 slaves=sfp1,sfp2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3

Verbose export:

/interface bonding
add arp=enabled arp-interval=100ms arp-ip-targets="" comment="Primary Bonded Interface" disabled=no down-delay=0ms lacp-rate=30secs link-monitoring=mii mii-interval=100ms min-links=0 mode=balance-rr mtu=1500 name=bonding1 primary=none slaves=sfp1,sfp2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3 up-delay=0ms

If you're really using a MT Switch, you cannot use LACP (only option is balance-xor, don't know if synology supports that).
CCR1009 should not be a problem, remember to use ether 5-8 and not 1-4 (1-4 are connected to CPU with 1Gbps in total).

Hi!

I've got my CRS today and want to replace my RB and my HP Switch with just one device.
I use 3 ISPs.
So I configured 3 Ports for those ISPs, a 4th as LAN (with the local IP) and made all other ports slaves of this port (so LAN is master).
Is this the way this is usually done?

Now my problem: I have a FreeNAS that supports link aggreagtion using LACP. This worked flawlessly with the HP switch. But how do I configure this with the CRS?
As I understand I have to add the 2 Ports the FreeNAS is connected to as a bonded port, something like:
0 name="Data" mtu=1500 mac-address=4C:5E:0C:93:F1:4A arp=enabled slaves=ether23,ether24 mode=802.3ad primary=none link-monitoring=mii arp-interval=100ms
arp-ip-targets="" mii-interval=100ms down-delay=0ms up-delay=0ms lacp-rate=30secs transmit-hash-policy=layer-2


BUT: if I configure ports23 and 24 to this bonding, I can't make them slave of LAN port, so these ports become isolated.
I won't have to make a bridge or something, do I?

I don't know exactly about freeNAS, but this works with CRS switch hardware support and my Thecus.
On the CRS use trunking on the switch chip (this is balance-xor, 802.3ad is not available yet):
Code: Select all

/interface ethernet switch trunk
add member-ports=ether23,ether24 name=trunk-NAS

On the NAS side, use balance-xor as the agregation type (if available).

Thank you. Do you / does anybody know, if any of those options (and if so, which one :) ) corresponds to balance-xor?

Failover
FEC (Fast Ether Channel)
LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
Load Balancing
Roundrobin

(if any, one of the last two, I'd say...)
Normally I'd just try, but I remember changing link aggregation on FreeNAS to be quite a ... thing.

Ok. Tried it on my NAS. Load Balancing instead of balance-xor works ok as well (i dare to say even better). Probably round robin would also do.
