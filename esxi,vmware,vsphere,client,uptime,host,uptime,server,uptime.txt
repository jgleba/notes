Hi,

On the GUI click on the host server (top left corner), then go to performance tab. (about middle of the screen)
Here chose from the scroll down menu the system. / Switch to: System /  (top right side of the screen)
And then on the bottom of the page: / Performance Chart Legend /

Find the host(server) name: this is the Object on the left side. / Key | Object /
The middle is called Measurement: and this is the Uptime of the server.
It shows the Uptime in days exactly just like in the ssh console.


VSPHERE CLIENT -> PERFORMANCE TAB -> SWITCH TO: SYSTEM -> FIND HOSTNAME OF ESXI -> VALUES ON RIGHT ARE UPTIME IN DAYS
