The Splunk Add-ons for Active Directory come with the Splunk App for Windows Infrastructure installation package. You can download the Splunk App for Windows Infrastructure from Splunk Apps.

Configure the Splunk Add-ons for Active Directory

The Splunk Add-ons for Active Directory do not require any configuration edits by default. When you deploy them onto the Active Directory domain controllers, they immediately begin collecting data as long as you have configured audit policy. 

NOT MAKING SENSE!

SEEMS LIKE I NEED TO INSTALL AN APP ON THE WIN SPLUNK FORWARDER, NOBODY ACTUALLY SAYING THAT THOUGH

If you do not have a search head in your topology, then your indexer is the search head by default. So there is no issue there.

The data check for Active Directory is failing. This is because either:

    The msad index does not exist on your indexer

    The domain controllers are not sending data to the msad index - they only do this if you installed the correct Active Directory add-on in the universal forwarder on each DC.

    The user has not been set up to search the msad index by default.

Problem resolved by Install TA for DomainController to Windows Server that you need to monitor. I extract the TA for DomainController from Splunk app for microsoft exchange.
