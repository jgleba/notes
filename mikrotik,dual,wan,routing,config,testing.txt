With default config, eth3,4,5 are slave ports to eth2.

Using Winbox, go to Interfaces > Interface and edit eth2,3,4 and 5. In the "Master Port" dropdown, set it to None.

Go to IP > Addresses, remove default entries.
- Add entry, IP 192.168.1.1, interface Eth1
- Add entry, IP 10.0.0.1, interface Eth2
- Add entry, IP 192.168.2.1, interface Eth3
- Add entry, IP 20.0.0.1, interface Eth4

To make Lan #1 go out Wan #1, and Lan #2 go out Wan #2, you have to mark packets coming in on eth1 and eth3

Go to IP > Firewall, Mangle
- Add entry, Chain=prerouting, in-interface: eth1, action: mark routing, New Routing Mark: LAN1
- Add entry, Chain=prerouting, in-interface: eth3, action: mark routing, New Routing Mark: LAN2

Packets leaving a gateway must be masqueraded (so the outbound packets take on the wan interface's IP).

Go to IP > Firewall, NAT
- Remove default masquerade rule
- Add entry, chain: srcnat, Out-Interface: Eth2, Action: Masquerade
- Add entry, chain: srcnat, Out-Interface: Eth4, Action: Masquerade

Because you use static IPs for your WANs, you need to manually create the routes
Go to IP > Routes
- Add Entry, Dst. Address: 0.0.0.0/0, Gateway: 10.0.0.254, Routing Mark: LAN1
- Add Entry, Dst. Address: 0.0.0.0/0, Gateway: 20.0.0.254, Routing Mark: LAN2

I believe that's it.
