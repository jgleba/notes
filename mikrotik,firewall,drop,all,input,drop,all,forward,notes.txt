MIKROTIK FIREWALL - DROP ALL ON FORWARD
092819

TRYING TO ACHIEVE BEST FIREWALL - SHOULD BE DROP ALL ON INPUT, DROP ALL ON FORWARD AS LAST RULES

EVERY TIME I TRIED TO IMPLEMENT, CONNECTIVITY WOULD BE LOST IN SOME WAY, HAD TO REVERT

FOUND THIS:

THIS SEEMED TO BE THE IDEA I WAS MISSING

you have to allowed clients src-addresses before the last drop rule.

TRIED THIS:

add action=accept chain=input comment="ALLOW ALL JGDC LOCAL NETWORKS - INPUT - TESTING 092719" src-address-list=JGDC1NetworksALL
add action=accept chain=forward comment="ALLOW ALL JGDC LOCAL NETWORKS - FORWARD - TESTING 092719" src-address-list=JGDC1NetworksALL
add action=drop chain=input comment="DROP EVERYTHING ELSE ON INPUT"
add action=drop chain=forward comment="DROP EVERYTHING ELSE ON FORWARD - ENABLED 092719 - SEEMS TO BE WORKING"

CREATED ADDRESS LIST WITH ALL LOCAL NETWORK SUBNETS

WORKING SO FAR
