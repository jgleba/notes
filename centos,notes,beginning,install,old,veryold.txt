changing vm memory from mac - prlctl

Configuring Main Memory

To configure the amount of memory that will be available to the virtual machine, use the --memsize option of the prlctl set command. The following session shows how to change the amount of memory for the MyVM virtual machine from 512 MB to 756 MB and to check that the new value has been successfully set:

# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep memory

memory 512Mb

# prlctl set MyVM --memsize 756

Set the memsize parameter to 756Mb

The VM has been successfully configured.

# prlctl list -i MyVM | grep memory

memory 756Mb
