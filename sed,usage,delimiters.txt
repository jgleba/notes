Delimiters in sed substitution

When using sed's substitute command, this is the most common syntax:

echo foo | sed s/foo/bar/ 

Here sed is used to replace the text foo with bar before it is echoed. The delimiter of choice is a forward slash (/), which is the most commonly used delimiter. However, sed can use any character as a delimiter. In fact, it will automatically use the character following the s as a delimiter.

For example, this works:

echo foo | sed s,foo,bar,

echo foo | sed 's foo bar '
