You should be able to do

echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack

Make sure to do this as a superuser, regular system users do not have permission to alter this value.

This change is not parmanent by the way, add the following to your /etc/sysctl.conf to apply it on boot and you can use sysctl -p to directly apply the changes:

echo "net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
