No, using NTLMv1 for authentication is no longer considered safe and should be avoided, especially for sensitive services like Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway). Here's why:
Why NTLMv1 Is Unsafe

    Weak Hashing Algorithm
    NTLMv1 uses the outdated DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for hashing, which is vulnerable to brute-force and cryptographic attacks. Modern computing power makes cracking NTLMv1 hashes relatively easy.

    No Salting
    NTLMv1 does not use salting, making password hashes susceptible to precomputed attacks, such as rainbow table attacks.

    Pass-the-Hash Attacks
    If an attacker intercepts an NTLMv1 hash, they can use it to authenticate to other systems without knowing the actual password.

    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerabilities
    NTLMv1 is more susceptible to MITM attacks, where an attacker intercepts authentication traffic and replays it to gain unauthorized access.

    Lack of Modern Security Features
    NTLMv1 lacks support for modern security protocols like channel binding and Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA), which protect against certain MITM attacks.

Recommended Alternatives

    NTLMv2
    Use NTLMv2, which is much more secure than NTLMv1. It uses stronger hashing (HMAC-MD5) and includes additional security features like message integrity checks.

    Kerberos
    Kerberos is a more secure and modern authentication protocol than NTLM and should be preferred whenever possible. It is especially effective in environments with Active Directory.

    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    Add MFA to your RD Gateway configuration to provide an additional layer of protection, reducing reliance on NTLM altogether.

    Certificate-Based Authentication
    Use SSL/TLS certificates or smart cards for authentication to reduce the reliance on password-based protocols like NTLM.

How to Disable NTLMv1

To enforce stronger authentication methods:

    Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
    Navigate to:
    Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options
    Set Network security: LAN Manager authentication level to:
    Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.

This will block NTLMv1 (and LM, an even older protocol) while enforcing NTLMv2.
