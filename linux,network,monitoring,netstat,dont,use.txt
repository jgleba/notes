Connections in TIME_WAIT state are harmless and don't really consume any resources anymore. They are kept by the kernel on a server for some time for the rare event that it still receives a package after the connection was closed. The default time a closed connection is held in that state is typically 120 seconds (or 2 times the maximum segment lifetime)

    TIME_WAIT are harmless on the server side. You can easily reach millions without any issues.

If you still want to reduce that number to release connections earlier, you can instruct the kernel to do so. To e.g. set it to 30 seconds execute this:

echo 30 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout

If you have many connections (either in TIME_WAIT or not), netstat, lsof, ipcs perform very poorly and actually slow the whole system down. To quote Willy again:

    There are two commands that you must absolutely never use in a monitoring system :

        netstat -a
        ipcs -a

    Both of them will saturate the system and considerably slow it down when something starts to go wrong. For the sockets you should use what's in /proc/net/sockstat. You have all the numbers you want. If you need more details, use ss -a instead of netstat -a, it uses the netlink interface and is several orders of magnitude faster.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, ss is available in the iproute or iproute2 package (depending on the version of your distribution).
