Currently best stack for WordPress:
Ubuntu LTS + Nginx + Fastcgi Cache + PHP-FPM + PHP OPcache + MySQL/MariaDB + Redis object cache
literally this stack cannot be beat when configured correctly and pretty simple to do
there are LEMP stack auto-installers can do this....
e.g. SlickStack or Centminmod (EasyEngine v3 / WordOps backup option)
P.s. for shared server you can add Apache/control panel if *must*
