Problem solved.  There is a bug in Exchange 2013 SP1 that Microsoft is currently working on.  The temporary workaround is to disable content indexing on the DB while you move your mailboxes by running:

Disable the content index on the database as follows:
Set-MailboxDatabase DB -IndexEnabled:$False

Enable the content index on the database as follows:
Set-MailboxDatabase DB -IndexEnabled:$True

CHECKING

Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus  | ft -wrap -autosize name, status, contentindexstate,contentindexerrormessage

TRYING, SEEMS TO BE WORKING

Set-MailboxDatabase DB -IndexEnabled:$False

ONCE IMPORTS ARE COMPLETED

Set-MailboxDatabase DB -IndexEnabled:$True

To resolve the issue, do the following:

    Create a new Active Directory group that is named "ContentSubmitters" and then grant Admistrators and NetworkService full access to the group using the Security tab on the AD object. This is a dummy group and should be used as a placeholder only. You might want to add a description so that the group is not removed.
    Force or wait for Active Directory replication.
    Restart the following services:
        Microsoft Exchange Search
        Microsoft Exchange Search Host Controller

This worked a treat for me! Almost immediately the StalledDuetoCI changed to either CopyingMessages or InitalSeeding on the problem mailboxes. The migration continues!
