keeps normal logs but pipes to logger, making available in local1 which hits global messages log

        ErrorLog "|/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/tee -a /var/log/httpd/bookstack.jgleba.com/error.log | /usr/bin/logger -thttpd -plocal1.err'"
        CustomLog "| /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/tee -a /var/log/httpd/bookstack.jgleba.com/access.log | /usr/bin/logger -thttpd -plocal1.notice'" combined

First open /etc/http/conf/httpd.conf and locate the ErrorLog directive and change it like this:

Errorlog apache directive

I have used the syslog facility local2, you should not use local7 which is Apache default facility as it is used to log boot message to /var/log/boot.log on CentOS 7.
Then add the following line to your rsyslog.conf

local2.error /var/log/httpd-error.log

Restart your Apache server

systemctl restart httpd

Then restart your Rsyslog service

systemctl restart rsyslog

Check the two services status

systemctl status rsyslog httpd

TEST
logger "Test message from the system `hostname`"

WILDCARD IN FOLDER

WildCards

Before Version: 8.25.0
    Wildcards are only supported in the filename part, not in directory names.

    /var/log/*.log works. *
    /var/log/*/syslog.log does not work. *

Since Version: 8.25.0
    Wildcards are supported in filename and paths which means these samples will work:

    /var/log/*.log works. *

    /var/log/*/syslog.log works. *

    /var/log/*/*.log works. *

    All matching files in all matching subfolders will work. Note that this may decrease performance in imfile depending on how many directories and files are being watched dynamically.
