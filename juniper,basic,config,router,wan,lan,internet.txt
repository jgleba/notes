how do you put an ip address on a vlan on ge-0/0/0 on vsrx
ChatGPT said:

To assign an IP address to a VLAN interface on ge-0/0/0 on a Juniper vSRX (or any Junos device), you need to:

    Create a VLAN logical interface (e.g., ge-0/0/0.100).

    Assign the VLAN ID (a vlan-tag) to that unit.

    Assign the IP address to the logical interface.

‚úÖ Example: Assign IP 192.168.10.1/24 to VLAN 100 on ge-0/0/0
Step-by-step in CLI configuration mode:

configure

# Create the VLAN interface
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 vlan-id 100
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

commit

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

    ge-0/0/0 must be connected to a trunk or device that is tagging VLAN 100.

    If you're using bridge domains or irb interfaces for routing between VLANs, the setup is a bit different ‚Äî let me know if that's your case.

    If you want to put the IP on a routed VLAN interface, you can also use irb interfaces. Here's how:

üîÅ Alternate: Using irb.100 (Routed Interface for VLAN 100)

This is used when ge-0/0/0 is part of a bridge domain or VLAN switching setup.

configure

# Configure VLAN
set vlans VLAN100 vlan-id 100
set vlans VLAN100 l3-interface irb.100

# Assign interface to VLAN
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members VLAN100
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk

# Configure routed interface
set interfaces irb unit 100 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

commit

Let me know if you're doing switching (L2) or just want a tagged interface (L3) ‚Äî I can tailor the config to that.
You said:
now I'm getting only unit 0 is valid for this encapsulation
ChatGPT said:

The error "only unit 0 is valid for this encapsulation" means you're trying to configure a VLAN subinterface (e.g., unit 100) on a physical interface that doesn't support VLAN tagging in that mode.

This happens when the interface is in Ethernet switching mode, which only allows unit 0.
‚úÖ Two Options to Fix It
‚úÖ Option 1: Use family inet with VLAN tagging

If you're doing Layer 3 (routed) interfaces, don't configure ethernet-switching.

Instead, create a VLAN-tagged subinterface directly:

delete interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 vlan-id 100
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

Then commit.
This puts IP directly on ge-0/0/0.100 for VLAN 100.
‚úÖ Option 2: If you want L2 switching, use irb instead

If you're using VLANs in switching mode (e.g. trunk/access), configure like this:

# Assign interface to VLAN in switching mode
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members VLAN100

# Define VLAN and link to IRB
set vlans VLAN100 vlan-id 100
set vlans VLAN100 l3-interface irb.100

# Assign IP to the VLAN via IRB
set interfaces irb unit 100 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Mix These:

    ethernet-switching ‚Üí for bridging/L2

    family inet on subinterfaces ‚Üí for L3 routed VLANs

They cannot coexist on the same physical interface.

Let me know whether you're doing L2 switching with routing or just tagged IP interfaces ‚Äî I can give exact config.
You said:
now I get vlan0id can only be specific on tagged ethernet interfaces
ChatGPT said:

That error ‚Äî ‚Äúvlan-id can only be specified on tagged ethernet interfaces‚Äù ‚Äî means you're trying to set a vlan-id on a logical unit of an interface that is not explicitly configured for 802.1Q tagging.

By default, Junos assumes untagged unless you explicitly set the encapsulation to 802.1Q.
‚úÖ Fix: Set the encapsulation to vlan-ccc or ethernet-ccc

But for L3 VLAN tagging, use this:

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 encapsulation vlan-ccc

Or on some platforms (like vSRX), you may need:

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 encapsulation vlan-ethernet

However, the correct and most common encapsulation for L3 VLANs is:

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 encapsulation vlan-ccc

‚úÖ Full working example: L3 tagged VLAN 100 on ge-0/0/0

delete interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0  # Clean up old config if needed

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 encapsulation vlan-ccc
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 vlan-id 100
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 100 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

commit

This gives you:

    Interface: ge-0/0/0.100

    Tagged with VLAN 100

    IP: 192.168.10.1/24

Let me know if you're seeing any specific platform restriction (e.g., on older vSRX) ‚Äî some versions only allow VLANs via bridge and irb.
You said:
I did this and commited, how do I add a dncp server and nat rule to allow internet: set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24
ChatGPT said:

Since you're using ge-0/0/0.0 with IP 192.168.10.1/24, and you want to:

    Add a DHCP server on that interface

    Enable NAT so clients can access the internet

Here's how to do it step by step.
‚úÖ 1. Add DHCP server

Assuming ge-0/0/0.0 is your internal/trusted interface (LAN):

configure

set system services dhcp pool 192.168.10.0/24 address-range low 192.168.10.100 high 192.168.10.200
set system services dhcp pool 192.168.10.0/24 router 192.168.10.1

This enables DHCP for clients in 192.168.10.100‚Äì200, with the router as the gateway.
‚úÖ 2. Configure NAT for Internet access

Assuming you have an internet-facing interface (like ge-0/0/1.0) with a public IP or DHCP from your ISP.
Define security zones:

set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0

Enable system services (like ping, ssh) if needed:

set security zones security-zone trust host-inbound-traffic system-services all
set security zones security-zone untrust host-inbound-traffic system-services all

Create source NAT rule:

set security nat source rule-set trust-to-untrust from zone trust
set security nat source rule-set trust-to-untrust to zone untrust
set security nat source rule-set trust-to-untrust rule all-traffic match source-address 0.0.0.0/0
set security nat source rule-set trust-to-untrust rule all-traffic then source-nat interface

This creates source NAT (masquerade) using the external interface IP.
‚úÖ 3. Allow traffic between zones

Create a policy to allow LAN clients out to the internet:

set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-internet match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-internet match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-internet match application any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-internet then permit

‚úÖ 4. Commit the configuration

commit

‚úÖ Recap:
Component	Interface	Notes
LAN	ge-0/0/0.0	IP: 192.168.10.1, DHCP, in trust zone
WAN	ge-0/0/1.0	IP from ISP, NAT out, in untrust zone

Let me know your WAN interface name and how it's configured (static or DHCP) if you'd like a full example.
You said:
I'm getting: interface ge-0/0/1.0 must be configured under interfaces
ChatGPT said:

That error ‚Äî "interface ge-0/0/1.0 must be configured under interfaces" ‚Äî means you tried to reference ge-0/0/1.0 (likely in a security zone or NAT rule), but you haven‚Äôt actually configured anything under that interface yet.

JunOS requires the interface to have at least a basic config (like family inet, even without an IP) before it can be added to zones or used for NAT.
‚úÖ Quick Fix: Configure the WAN interface

If you're using DHCP from your ISP (most common), do this:

configure

set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet dhcp

This tells JunOS to obtain an IP automatically from your ISP on ge-0/0/1.0.

If you're using a static public IP, use this instead:

set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address <your-public-ip>/<prefix-length>

Example:

set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 203.0.113.5/30

‚úÖ Then re-apply your zone/NAT settings

Now you can safely run:

set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0

And the NAT configuration should also work without that error.
‚úÖ Final checklist

    ge-0/0/0.0: LAN, IP: 192.168.10.1/24

    ge-0/0/1.0: WAN, gets IP via DHCP (or static)

    Zones:

        ge-0/0/0.0 in trust

        ge-0/0/1.0 in untrust

    NAT: Source NAT from trust ‚Üí untrust

    Policy: trust to untrust allow all

You said:
I get dhcp incompatible with the dhcp server configured under system services dhcp
ChatGPT said:

That error ‚Äî ‚Äúdhcp incompatible with the dhcp server configured under system services dhcp‚Äù ‚Äî means that JunOS does not allow a device to act as both a DHCP client and a DHCP server at the same time on the same routing instance.

You're probably:

    Running DHCP client on the WAN (ge-0/0/1.0)

    Running DHCP server on the LAN (ge-0/0/0.0)

This is normally allowed, but not on older JunOS versions or if the DHCP server is globally configured under system services dhcp.
‚úÖ Two options to fix it:
‚úÖ Option 1: Move DHCP server to access mode (preferred for newer configs)

Instead of using the old-style system services dhcp, use an access address-assignment pool, which is compatible with DHCP client on the WAN:

delete system services dhcp   # Remove old global DHCP server config

# Configure access address-assignment DHCP pool
set access address-assignment pool LAN-POOL family inet network 192.168.10.0/24
set access address-assignment pool LAN-POOL family inet range CLIENTS low 192.168.10.100
set access address-assignment pool LAN-POOL family inet range CLIENTS high 192.168.10.200
set access address-assignment pool LAN-POOL family inet dhcp-attributes router 192.168.10.1

# Link pool to the LAN interface
set forwarding-options dhcp-relay server-group LOCAL-GROUP 0.0.0.0
set forwarding-options dhcp-relay active-server-group LOCAL-GROUP
set forwarding-options dhcp-relay group LAN interface ge-0/0/0.0

‚úÖ Option 2: Use a routing-instance for WAN (workaround)

Put the WAN interface in a separate virtual routing-instance so DHCP client won't conflict with the global DHCP server.

But this is more complex and usually overkill unless you already need virtual routing tables.
‚úÖ Recommendation

If you just want it to work easily:

    Use system services dhcp for the LAN DHCP server

    And configure a static IP on the WAN interface (skip DHCP client)

Example:

set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 203.0.113.5/30

If you must use DHCP client on WAN and DHCP server on LAN, then go with Option 1 (access address-assignment).

Would you like me to generate a full working config for Option 1?

How do I switch from dhcp client on interface ge0/0/1 to a static ip
ChatGPT said:

To switch ge-0/0/1 from DHCP client to a static IP, you just need to:

    Delete the DHCP client config

    Assign a static IP address

‚úÖ Step-by-step:

Enter configuration mode:

configure

    Delete DHCP client on interface:

delete interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet dhcp

    Set static IP address (replace with your real IP & subnet):

set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 203.0.113.5/30

    üîÅ Example above sets static IP 203.0.113.5 with a /30 subnet.
    Replace with your actual public IP and subnet mask.

    (Optional) Set default gateway:

If your ISP requires a specific gateway (e.g., 203.0.113.1), set:

set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 203.0.113.1

    Commit the changes:

commit

Let me know if you want to verify connectivity or NAT after this.
You said:
how do I just switch the ip on ge-0/0/0 with the ip on ge-0/0/1
ChatGPT said:

To swap the IP addresses between ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, you need to:

    Delete the current IPs from both interfaces.

    Assign each IP to the opposite interface.

    (Optional) Update security zones or NAT policies if needed.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Example:

Let‚Äôs say:

    ge-0/0/0 currently has 192.168.10.1/24

    ge-0/0/1 currently has 203.0.113.5/30

You want to switch them.
1. Enter configuration mode:

configure

2. Remove the existing IPs:

delete interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24
delete interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 203.0.113.5/30

3. Assign the IPs to the opposite interfaces:

set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 203.0.113.5/30
set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.10.1/24

4. (Optional) Update your default route if it used the old WAN gateway:

delete routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0
set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 203.0.113.1

    Replace 203.0.113.1 with your actual gateway for the new WAN IP.

5. (Optional) Update security zones:

If ge-0/0/0.0 was in trust and ge-0/0/1.0 was in untrust, you probably need to switch them too:

delete security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0
delete security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0

set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0

6. Commit the configuration:

commit
