what to do when delete user?

does client need access to account? if so, change pass, give pass. Advise of still being billed for user.

if not:

export all email
attach mailbox to other user if desired
forward email to other user - delete mailbox, create alias in exchange and reflexion
alias in exchange is just adding another email address in exchange management
