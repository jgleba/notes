by default nginx seems to create new files with 644, want to change to maybe 664:

sudo systemctl edit php-fpm.service

added to override file:

umask 0002

sudo systemctl restart php-fpm.service

TRYING

OVERRIDE FILE IS THERE, BUT NOT WORKING

sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart php-fpm && sudo systemctl restart nginx

TRYING THIS

sudo nano /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf

change listen.mode from commented, default, 0660 to 0664, shouldn't make a change, but trying

NO CHANGE

Hi.
What I do to achieve read / write on the /var/www directory is, beside doing all the solutions given in above I like to set ACL's on the directory, which solves my read/write problem for particular user.

For example :

setfacl -d -R -m u:amol:rwx /var/www

-d : Default ACL permissions applied on new files
-R : Apply the ACL permissions recursively
-m : To set permissions

sudo setfacl -d -R -m u:nginx:nginx ./wpgreeeninfo/wp-content/plugins/wp-instagram-post/vendor/mgp25/instagram-php/sessions/greeenorg
